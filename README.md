# Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-ray images (Minor Project)


This is a minor project focused on detecting **Pneumonia** from **Chest X-ray** images using **machine-learning / deep-learning**. The goal is to support early diagnosis by building an AI model that can classify chest X-ray as *Normal* or *Pneumonia*.

## Project Status

**Planing Phase** - Tools, dataset, and methodology not finalized yet.
This README will be updated as the development begins in the upcoming days.


---

## Planned Objective

- Study how pneumonia can be detected from chest x-ray images.
- Learn and implement deep learning models (CNNs).
- Train and evaluate the model using real-world hospital data.
- Explore model expandability.
- Present the findings as a research-style academic project.


---

## Dataset (Yet to be decided)

- The dataset will be based on real-world data obtained from the hospital primarily focused on Nepal.


---

## Tools and Tech Stack (To be decided)

- After completing the second objective and holding a team discussion, we will finalize the tech stack suitable for this project.
